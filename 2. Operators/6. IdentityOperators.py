# --- IDENTITY OPERATORS ---
# 'is'      -> checks if two objects have the SAME memory location (id)
# 'is not'  -> checks if two objects have DIFFERENT memory locations

# Example 1: Numbers (small integers are cached in Python)
a = 10
b = 10
print("a is b:", a is b)           # True (same memory for small integers)
print("a is not b:", a is not b)   # False

# Example 2: Large integers (may not share memory)
x = 1000
y = 1000
print("x is y:", x is y)           # Might be False (depends on Python version/implementation)
print("x == y:", x == y)           # True (values are equal even if memory differs)

# Example 3: Strings (interning may happen for small strings)
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "hello"
print("s1 is s2:", s1 is s2)       # True (string interning)
print("s1 == s2:", s1 == s2)       # True (values equal)

# Example 4: Lists (mutable, so memory is different)
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
print("list1 == list2:", list1 == list2)   # True (same contents)
print("list1 is list2:", list1 is list2)   # False (different memory locations)

# Example 5: None check (best use of 'is')
val = None
print("val is None:", val is None)         # True (recommended way to check None)
print("val is not None:", val is not None) # False
